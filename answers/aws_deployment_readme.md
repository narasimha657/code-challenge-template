```

## üõ†Ô∏è Core AWS Services

### API Hosting
- **Amazon ECS with Fargate** - Containerized FastAPI application with auto-scaling
- **Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution and health checks
- **Amazon ECR** - Container image registry

### Database
- **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** - Managed database with automated backups and scaling
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for high availability

### Scheduled Data Ingestion
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless function triggered daily to check for new weather data
- **Amazon EventBridge** - Scheduled triggers (cron-like scheduling)
- **Amazon S3** - Storage for weather data files
- **ECS Tasks** - On-demand data processing containers

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **AWS CDK/CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as Code
- **AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild** - CI/CD automation
- **Amazon VPC** - Network isolation and security

## üöÄ Deployment Flow

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Deploy VPC, RDS, ECS cluster using CDK
2. **Container Deployment**: Build and push FastAPI image to ECR
3. **Service Configuration**: Deploy ECS service with auto-scaling policies
4. **Scheduling Setup**: Deploy Lambda function with EventBridge triggers
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment on code changes

## üìä Operational Features

### Monitoring
- **CloudWatch** - Application logs, metrics, and custom dashboards
- **CloudWatch Alarms** - Automated alerts for CPU, memory, and error rates
- **AWS X-Ray** - Distributed tracing for performance optimization

### Security
- **VPC with private subnets** - Database isolation
- **IAM roles and policies** - Least privilege access
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Secure credential storage
- **Security Groups** - Network-level firewalls

### Scaling & Performance
- **ECS Auto Scaling** - Scale containers based on CPU/memory usage
- **RDS Read Replicas** - Scale database reads
- **CloudFront CDN** - Cache API responses and reduce latency

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

- **Fargate Spot** - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
- **Scheduled Scaling** - Scale down during low-traffic hours
- **S3 Intelligent Tiering** - Automatic storage cost optimization
- **Reserved Instances** - Long-term cost savings for predictable workloads

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: $100-300 depending on traffic and data volume

## üîÑ Data Processing Workflow

### Daily Ingestion Process
1. **Trigger**: EventBridge rule fires daily at 6 AM UTC
2. **Check**: Lambda function checks S3 for new weather files
3. **Process**: If new data found, trigger ECS task for ingestion
4. **Calculate**: Automatically run statistics calculation after ingestion
5. **Monitor**: CloudWatch tracks success/failure and performance

### API Request Flow
1. **Request**: User hits API endpoint via Load Balancer
2. **Route**: ALB routes to healthy ECS container
3. **Process**: FastAPI application processes request
4. **Query**: Database query via RDS PostgreSQL
5. **Response**: JSON response returned to user

## üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Backup

- **Multi-AZ RDS** - Automatic failover for database
- **ECS Service** - Multiple containers across availability zones
- **Automated Backups** - Daily RDS backups with 7-day retention
- **Health Checks** - Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Blue/Green Deployment** - Zero-downtime updates

## ‚ö° Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically  
‚úÖ **Managed Services** - Reduced operational overhead  
‚úÖ **Cost Efficient** - Pay only for resources used  
‚úÖ **Secure** - AWS security best practices built-in  
‚úÖ **Reliable** - Multi-AZ deployment with automated failover  
‚úÖ **Automated** - Scheduled data processing without manual intervention

## üéØ Summary

This AWS deployment provides a production-ready, scalable solution using managed services to minimize operational complexity while ensuring high availability, security, and cost efficiency. The architecture supports both real-time API requests and scheduled batch processing with comprehensive monitoring and automated scaling.
